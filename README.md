## Description
This project is my intent to use You need a budget (YNAB) (ref: https://www.youneedabudget.com/).
I am just implementing the way I am using it, and how I have understood it. So this just a customized app for the way I am using. If you are using it, and are find it helpful, and you are willing to buy me a coffee (coffee is my main energy source), dont hesitate to send me some through https://www.buymeacoffee.com/, username @krausyd.
If you want to learn and use the whole product, don't hesitate in buying the book (https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-the-book/), I highly recommend it, and trying the official product.
## Technologies used
As part of the Fullstack Webdevelopment curriculum by Trilogy, this project uses the MERN stack:
* HTML
* React
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB

## Development phases
This project will be developed in 3 phases:
* Static front end phase. The page will basically be pretty much html, css, with not too much of data storage. Many of the storage will be done in local storage.
* Backend phase. The site will have a backend using mySQL and templates for front end, also the availability to create users, login, and password.
* MVC phase. The entire front end will be done in React + Redux. I will try to avoid GraphQL, and we will be migrating database to MongoDB.

All this is based in Trilogy Fullstack web development program. (More info https://www.trilogyed.com/programs/#web-curriculum)
