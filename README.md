## Description
This project is my intent to use You need a budget (YNAB) (ref: https://www.youneedabudget.com/).
I am just implementing the way I am using it, and how I have understood it. So this just a customized app for the way I am using. If you are using it, and are find it helpful, and you are willing to buy me a coffee (coffee is my main energy source), dont hesitate to send me some through https://www.buymeacoffee.com/, username @krausyd.
If you want to learn and use the whole product, don't hesitate in buying the book (https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-the-book/), I highly recommend it, and trying the official product.
